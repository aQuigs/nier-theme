# nier-theme
The Nier theme is an Obsidian theme inspired by the UI of the video game "NieR: Automata" by Yoko Taro.

This theme tries to be as close looking to the game menu while still being usable and easy on the eyes with the warm "mono" color scheme.

## link
### internal link
They have 2 different colors to indicate if the link points to an existing note or not. While there are 2 colors for internal links, they are close enough to not be distracting but different enough to remind you that you can create a note on a link.

### external link
While internal links are brown/red, **external** links are blue with a small logo to make it easy to differentiate them from internal links.

## callout and code bloc

With less flashy colors to be more gentle with the eyes.
